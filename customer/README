Q. Differnece between Open Feign and netflix feign.
=> Netflix developed netflix feign.
Spring Cloud Netflix integrates the Netflix OSS offerings into the Spring Cloud ecosystem.
This includes Feign, Eureka, Ribbon, and a host of other tools and utilities.
However, Feign was given its own Spring Cloud Starter to allow access to just Feign.

Ultimately, Netflix decided to stop using Feign internally and ceased its development.
As a result of this decision, Netflix fully transferred (Including development and write access) Feign
    to the open-source community under a new project named OpenFeign.
Luckily, it continues to receive immense support from the open-source community and has seen many new features and updates.




Q. Dependecies and differences?

=> 1. Netflix feign
            <dependency>
                <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
                <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-feign</artifactId>
                <versionId>1.4.7.RELEASE</versionID>
            </dependency>
            <dependency>
                <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
                <artifactId>spring-cloud-dependencies</artifactId>
                <version>Hoxton.SR8</version>
                <type>pom</type>
                <scope>import</scope>
            </dependency>

             this feign only works with Spring Boot 1.4.7 or earlier.
